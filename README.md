<h2>Installation</h2><br>

**Clone the repository:**
<br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adjsium/mj_figma_weather_app.git
```

**Get your API key?:** <br>


To fetch weather data, you'll need an API key from a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherAPI). Once you have the API key, create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following:


```javascript
REACT_APP_GEO_DB_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
```
**Start the development server:**


```bash
npm start
```
<br>

**The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000**

<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
Enter a location name or zip code in the search bar and press Enter.
The app will display the current weather conditions and the 5-day forecast for the specified location.<br>
